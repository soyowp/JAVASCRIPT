       <blockquote>I used to rule the world
        Seas would rise when I gave the word
        Now in the morning, I sleep alone
        Sweep the streets I used to own
        I used to roll the dice
        Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
        Listen as the crowd would sing
        Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!
        One minute I held the key
        Next the walls were closed on me
        And I discovered that my castles stand
        Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
        I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
        Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
        Be my mirror, my sword and shield
        My missionaries in a foreign field
        For some reason I can't explain
        Once you go there was never, never a honest word
        And that was when I ruled the world</blockquote>
